**2.Observations**

This error will thrown If the CORS configuration is not setup correctly.
Also there is a possible that the request is disallowed by the user's web application

Two Web URLs having different origins when they have different protocols or hosts.
For example, making a request from https://osa-web.t-cg.co.uk to https://osa-web.t-cg.co.uk/qatest is considered cross-origin as they have different hostnames.
A website is allowed to make requests to the same origin unless the response from other origins includes the right CORS headers.

A CORS error occurs when the server doesn’t return the CORS headers required.
For example, https://osa-web.t-cg.co.uk/qatest tries to make an API request. As https://osa-web.t-cg.co.uk/qatest is not included in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header of the response, the browser will display a CORS error.
